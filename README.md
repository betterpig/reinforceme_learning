# reinforceme_learning
this repository includes some programs used for RL study.
the torch_learning folder is almost the same as https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction but with my own comment.
the DRL_pytorch folder contains common deep reinforcement learning algorithms implemented by pytorch . I write most of them according to https://github.com/ljpzzz/machinelearning/tree/master/reinforcement-learning ,whose net are constructed by tensorflow.
